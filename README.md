clear-pebble
============

My second pebble watch face. Much cleaner than the first one, and I think it looks quite nice.

Again, feel free to use this (please do link back to my work though) as a starting point for watchfaces where you might want to store hours and minutes in separate variables and point out any bugs or style errors.
